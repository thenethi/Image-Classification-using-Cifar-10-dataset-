The project "Image Classification using CIFAR-10 dataset" aims to develop a deep learning model that can accurately classify images into one of the ten predefined classes. The CIFAR-10 dataset consists of 60,000 32x32 color images, divided into 50,000 training samples and 10,000 test samples. The model will be trained using various deep learning techniques, such as convolutional neural networks (CNNs), to extract meaningful features from the images. The project will focus on improving accuracy and minimizing loss through optimization algorithms and regularization techniques. The final goal is to create a robust and efficient image classifier that can be used in real-world applications.
